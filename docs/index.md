# Introduction

Trail automates the documentation of the Machine Learning development process, while bringing more transparency to your ML experiments. Start by using MLflow to track experiments and follow the steps in [getting started](Getting_started.md) or [quickstart](Quickstart.md).


# Features
trail comes with three main functionalities:

1. [**AI Registry**](AI_Registry): trail allows you to register your models and their use cases in a central place. This allows you to easily keep track of your AI use cases.
2. [**Experiment tracking**](Experiment_Management.md): trail tracks your experiments and their results in a tree structure. This allows you to easily compare different experiments, their evaluations and results.
3. [**Documentation-Engine**](Documentation_Engine.md): trail creates automated documentations based on all the ML Metadata in a central place. This allows you to easily share your results with your colleagues or external parties without the overhead.


For the full functionality, go through all three steps.
