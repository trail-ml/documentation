# The Documentation Engine 

The documentation engine is the core of trail. It creates automated documentations based on all the ML Metadata in a central place. This allows you to easily share your results with your colleagues or external parties without the overhead. You can find the "Documentation" page in the navbar of the [webapp](https://app.trail-ml.com).

Keep in mind that the documentation engine relies on the data that was tracked within the ML experiments (see [Experiment Management](Experiment_Management.md)).

The first view shows you all previously generated documentations. You can either open them or create a new one.

To create a Documentation follow these steps: 

- The "+" button opens a new documentation. Here you can choose the project and the experiment you want to document. You can also choose the template of the documentation.
- In the documentation view you can edit the layout by clicking on the tool button and add new ones by clicking on the "+" button.
- To organize your documentation choose as many of the components from the side bar as you like. You can choose from predefined components on the top or customizable components at the bottom. 


To include also text information you can use the google docs integration the settings page.
